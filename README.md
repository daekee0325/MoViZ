>“The whole of life is just like watching a film. Only it's as though you always get in ten minutes after the big picture has started, and no-one will tell you the plot, so you have to work it out all yourself from the clues.”  - **Terry Pratchett**

**MoViz** aims to vizualise databases about movies using the **d3.js** framework. I used a database from the https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata, which is basically a database of movies and further info provided by *Kaggle*. 

The interface of the program currently looks like: 

I believe that this program will be useful for two sets of people: 
  - People curious about the techniques that can be used to build any kind of data vizualization application from a database. 
  - People who want to **investigate** *d3.js* and data vizualization **using** *d3.js*. 
  
# How to Run the Program 

Running the program is a pretty simple task. Simply invoke the line below to get the program running on `localhost:888`:

```sh
npm start
```

In order to install any missing webmodules, simply invoke the line below on any IDE or terminal: 

```sh
npm install 
```

Please refer to my documentation and comments in order to gain more insight into the programs. 

# Tech Used
- *d3.js*
- *webpack.js*
- *npm*
 
### Todos

- Start using the **tmdb** database. 
- Whenever a user clicks on a UI element, we want the previous nodes to disappear.
